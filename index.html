      <h2>This site describes me and who I am.</h2>
      <p>I was born in Seattle and raised in Philadelphia. I moved to Atlanta after High School for a full ride to an arts school. Once there I dropped out because I wasnt ready for college. I became a bartender and then moved to Seattle for a few years. Then due to family, I retured to Philidelphia until I was 23 years old. By this time I was ready for college and decided to go to Clemson. Clemson home of the Tigers was a great place and time in my life. After graduation I moved back to Seattle and lived there for over 10 years. In 2015 I decided to move to Portland.
        Now that I am here, I decided to attend Epicodus and lean how to code.</p>
